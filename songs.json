  "I was told a million times of all the people in my way",
  "I was dreaming I was Al Capone",
  "I was nothin' but a city boy, my trumpet was my only toy",
  "I was a legend all through the land, I was blowin' to a million fans"

// When I was young it came to me
// And I could see the sun break in

// When i was you and you were me and we were very young
// Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung

// A baby I was when you took my hand
// And the light of the night burned bright

// Since I knew I was born
// But there ain't nobody wants to know

// I played around as well as I was able
// And soon we had the record of the year

// You'd have thought I was a happy man

// And I was
// Sleepin' like a princess

// How I was pushed around 'don't let it get you down'
